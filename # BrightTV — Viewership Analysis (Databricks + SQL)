## 📌 Project Overview
BrightTV provided raw TV viewership session logs in CSV format.  
I cleaned the dataset, transformed it into structured tables, and performed analysis to uncover audience insights.  

This project demonstrates:
- Cleaning messy data into a usable format (timestamps, durations, user IDs).  
- Analytical SQL queries (channels, user behavior, time-of-day patterns).  
- Visualization and dashboard creation in Databricks.  
- Business insights and recommendations.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Databricks (SQL, Notebooks, Visualizations)  
- Spark SQL  
- GitHub (Portfolio Presentation)

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `notebooks/01_BrightTV_clean_and_preview.py` → cleaning + preparation notebook.  
- `queries/cleaning.sql` → SQL cleaning pipeline.  
- `queries/analysis.sql` → Analysis queries (top channels, trends, engagement).  
- `visuals/README.md` → list of dashboards & screenshots.

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Identified **most popular TV channels** by watch time.  
- Found **prime viewing hours** (18:00–22:00).  
- Analyzed **daily and weekly trends** including low-consumption days.  
- Ranked **top users** by engagement and session length.

## 📊 Visualizations
Created with Databricks Visualize:
- Treemap → Top channels by total minutes.  
- Line chart → Hourly viewing trend (prime time).  
- Heatmap → Weekday × Hour usage patterns.

## 🚀 Business Recommendations
1. **Boost low-consumption days** with targeted promotions and short-form content.  
2. **Maximize prime-time slots** with premium shows and ads.  
3. **Segment users** → reward heavy users, engage light users with free trials.
